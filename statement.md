Project Statement

This project, titled Farmer Market Product Tracker, is developed to provide a simple and effective way to manage agricultural product information.
The goal of the project is to help users keep track of product names, market names, and market rates through a command-line interface.
The system allows the user to perform basic operations such as adding new products, viewing stored products, updating rates, deleting entries, 
and performing simple analytics. All data is stored persistently in a text file so that information remains available across program executions.
This project demonstrates the use of file handling, functions, loops, conditional statements, and user input handling in Python. It serves as a beginner-friendly example of how to build a small but functional data management system without relying on external libraries or databases.
